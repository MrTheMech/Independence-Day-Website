            <h2>History</h2>
                <h4 id="historypara"> <font color = "FF0000">The Battle of Plassey</font>  was fought on June 23 1757, Victory for the East India Company of the British in the Battle of Plassey was the start of nearly two centuries of British rule in India. For an event with such earth-shattering consequences, it was an astonishingly insignificant military encounter because the defeat of the Nawab of Bengal credited much to betrayal for which the British were notorious. <br><br>

                    The East India Company ruled India for <font color = "FF0000">100 years</font>, after which it was replaced by direct British rule in the wake of the Indian uprising of 1857. <br> <br>
                    
                    The European and the British traders, to begin with, came to India for business drives. The Industrial Revolution in Britain led the way to the increase in demand for raw materials. Simultaneously, they also needed a market to sell their finished goods. India provided such a platform to Britain to fulfil all its requirements. <br> <br>
                    
                    The eighteenth century was a time of <font color = "FF0000">interior supremacy fight</font> in India, and with the decreasing power of the Mughals, the Britishers were provided with the picture-perfect opportunity to create their hold over Indian Territory. <br> <br>
                    
                    They controlled the sale of raw materials and accepted these at low prices; however, the Indian weavers had to buy them at excessive prices. Hefty duties were forced on Indian goods, inflowing Britain to shield their industry. Numerous investments were made to expand the transport and communication system in the country to smoothen the easy transfer of raw materials and finished goods. English education was also made known to create a class of educated Indians who would support the British in governing the country and reinforce their political authority. All these measures helped the British to establish, consolidate and continue their rule over India. <br> <br>  <br>

            <h2>Exploitation</h2>
                <h4 id = "exploitpara">
                    There was <font color = "FF0000">nothing positive</font> in the British rule of our country. India had to suffer disgraceful humiliation on a colossal scale and continual violence of a kind India had never suffered before. In a nutshell, British rule was an era of obscurity for India, all over which it agonised by numerous manufactured <font color = "FF0000">famines, wars, racism, maladministration, deportation</font> of its people to distant lands and economic exploitation on an unprecedented scale. A vexed Indians even stipulates a symbolic apology and public act of contrition from the British for all the damage they had caused to the nation. They <font color = "FF0000">looted India with impunity.</font> Whatever they did had their selfish motive and was against the poor Indians. They also perfected mastered a policy of <font color = "FF0000">divide and rule, breaking treaties to initiate wars and plunder the country.</font> According to one estimate, India’s share in the global GDP was around about 27% in 1700 AD, and it was <font color = "FF0000">3% in 1947.</font> <br> <br>  <br>

                <h2>What is Independence Day? Why is it celebrated?</h2>
                <h4 id="whatispara"> <font color = "F6921E">Independence Day of India,</font> which is celebrated religiously throughout the Country on the  <font color = "00A04E">15th of August every year</font>, holds tremendous ground in the list of national days, since it reminds every Indian about  <font color = "00A04E">the dawn of a new beginning</font>, the beginning of an era of deliverance from the clutches of British colonialism  of more than 200 years. It was on <font color = "00A04E">15th August 1947</font> that India was declared independent from British colonialism, and the reins of control were handed over to the leaders of the Country. India's gaining of independence was a tryst with destiny, as the struggle for freedom was a long and tiresome one, witnessing the sacrifices of many freedom fighters, who laid down their lives on the line. <br> <br> <br>
